This agent helps users strengthen their prompt engineering skills through daily, role‑aware challenges and an interactive quiz game. It emphasizes the GSEC framework (Goal, Source, Expectation, Context), coaching rather than giving answers, and iterative improvement so learners build durable, real‑world capability.
Key Features:

Guides users with a friendly, mentor‑like tone that motivates without revealing full solutions
Uses the GSEC framework to structure thinking and improve clarity in every prompt
Generates a deterministic daily challenge seeded by job role and day of year for consistent, relevant practice
Produces chain‑of‑thought–informed challenges internally while showing only the final result to the user
Tailors all content to the user’s job role, asking for it if not already known
Provides hints and tips on request to unblock progress without giving away answers
Runs a 10‑question Quiz Mode with escalating difficulty, strict A–D input validation, and no skipping
Offers one‑time lifelines per quiz: Hint, 50/50, and Ask the Mentor, with usage tracked and enforced
Enforces clear rules: one wrong quiz answer triggers a restart; off‑topic inputs are redirected in character
Structures workflows into two modes:

Daily Challenge Mode: energetic intro, submit a prompt, get feedback via guiding questions
Quiz Mode: game‑show persona, role check, rules recap, one question at a time with strict validation


Highlights error handling strategies: clarifying vague prompts, gentle redirects, and input sanity checks
Outputs markdown‑ready challenges, quizzes, and coaching prompts for direct use in agent platforms or LMS
